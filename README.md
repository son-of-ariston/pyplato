## What is Plato?

Plato is a modern programming language. It is intended to modernise and supersede C without losing on much of its simplicity and performance.

Plato is (aims to be) the following:

- compiled
- cross-platform
- curly-bracketed
- imperative
- procedural
- system language

## Progress

Plato is in its very early stages. It is born from the wishes of a Python programmer who years for a C that is as usable as Python. **It may never be finished.**

Currently, I am not looking for contributors. I may never look for maintainers outside of people I know personally in real life.

When the language is ready, its implementation will be bootstrapped. Until then it will be written in Python so the idea and implementation is as accessible as possible to what it aims to be.
